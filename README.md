After seeing (whitep4nth3r)[https://whitep4nth3r.com/] post about their (node-based business card )[https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/build-a-business-card-cli-tool/], I had to see how hard it was to do this project.

If you want to get my business card on your terminal window, simply run:
```npx ryan-james```

Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Thanks whitep4nth3r!
